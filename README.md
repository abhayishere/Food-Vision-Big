Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately estimates dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages over other methods.
However, how to derive the food information (e.g., food type and portion size) from food image effectively and efficiently remains a challenging and open research problem.

I propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based food image recognition algorithm to address this problem, and also **beating the original** DeepFood(Deep Learning-Based Food Image Recognition) by 4%.
Original paper had an accuracy of about 77% which took them 2-3 days to compile, while my model only took around 25 minutes, giving an accuracy of about 81.3%.

# Dependencies
* Tensorflow(2.4.1)
* Numpy
* Matplotlib (to visualize the datasets)
* datetime (to save TensorBoard callbacks)
